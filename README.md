**Eli-Lilly's Trillion Dollar Dream**

**Introduction**
In the technology industry, the term "FAANG" relates to the largest and most influential companies in the world: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. 
In the pharmaceutical industry, companies like Eli Lilly have the potential to join the levels of FAANG if they reach a valuation of 1 trillion dollars. As one of the leading pharmaceutical companies, Eli Lilly has a good history of innovation and a diverse portfolio of products.

>"Pharmaceutical companies often possess a strong economic moat derived from their exclusive patents on life-saving drugs, enabling them to charge high prices and maintain a loyal customer base. This moat, built on patients' reliance on medication and the high cost of entry for competitors, provides a significant barrier to entry in the industry." - Five Successful Stock Investing Principles, Morningstar

If Eli Lilly were to achieve a trillion-dollar valuation, it would not only signify its financial success but also its significant impact on healthcare. Other pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Merck also compete in the industry.
